### Briefly About Myself:

I have wanted to become an IT specialist for a long time. I first got acquainted with programming at the university where I studied. I found it quite amusing and now I cannot cease dreaming to be a great front-end developer. Having high motivation I am sure that my dream will come true. I find myself smart, hardworking, inquiring, and determined. I fancy working in a team, learning something new, and resolving interesting challenges.<br>
Having worked as a customer support representative I provided clients with information about hosting. I helped them register a new domain name, choose an appropriate hosting for their needs, and resolve their issues. I gained knowledge of how to communicate with customers, troubleshoot any issues.<br>
I bealive, that a clear study plan and a mentor will help me acquire sufficient knowledge and skills in programming. My dream of becoming a successful IT specialist will inspire and motivate me every day.<br>
